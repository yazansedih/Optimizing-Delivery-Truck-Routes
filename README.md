<h1>OptimizingDeliveryTruckRoutes</h1>

This project provides a web-based tool for visualizing and optimizing delivery truck routes. The tool helps allocate delivery points to trucks based on their capacity and provides an optimized solution using simulated annealing. The interface also allows users to visualize the routes and dynamically add delivery points.
